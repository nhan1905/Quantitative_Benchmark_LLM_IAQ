# 1. Introduction
This respiratory contains source codes for of manuscrip
# 2. Requirement for successfully re-implementing our mansucript
- OpenRouter API to access LLMs
  1) Login to OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/
  2) Create an API by following these steps: **Settings / API Key / Create API Key** 
- In this study, we used Google Colab platform. Several LLMs takes hours to complete generate solution for the entire 480 problems. Therefore, we encourge to user to use Pro+ version.
- Alternative, other platform can be used to run LLMs on local machine but this will be memory-consuming.
